FIRST, WE LOAD THE PAGE AS IN EX 0.5

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes

/// AFTERWARDS, What happens is that the browser sends the INPUT to the server, but makes no requests to re-load the page. The
    displaying process of the new NOTE is handled by JAVASCRIPT, but still the SERVER is updated to store the data onwards. This implies 
    that the only new step in the browser-server communication is the POST Method. It's important to say that the information Type is JSON.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

    And that's it!
